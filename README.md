FDM Expenses App 
Overview

Employees at FDM expense back any travel claims or additional costs due to work travel through our expenses system. Currently the process is very manual and time consuming for the employees, managers and expenses team especially in a fast-paced working environment. Simplifying this process can make a big difference to efficiency across all teams within the organisation. 

Client

FDM is a diverse global IT consultancy provider, employing graduates, ex-forces and returners to work. FDM provides award winning IT training and places consultants onsite.
FDM is looking to upgrade the expenses submission process to be easier, faster and more convenient.
