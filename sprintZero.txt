Questions for the Client:
-What platform would you like us to make the app on, android or ios?
        --Does this need to be a 'native' app for Android/iOS, or would a 'web app' be suitable - so, a website that scales reponsively to different views? ==> [reword to make simpler for client to understand?]
-What does the "2 week expenses process" entail?
-Does the app have to handle expenses in every single currency, or is there only a need to focus on the main ones?
-- How should the calculations be handled re. conversions? ie. convert everything to a single unified currency (GBP) for calculating the overall total expenses?
- username `can` be an email, can it be something else too? or is it just going to be an email?
- what is the enforced password policy?
- who can unlock a locked user account and how? (ideally only admin can email user a password reset link that unlocks it)
- when evidence is exported from travel apps such as Trailine:
    	- is the exported document to be formatted in any specific way?
    	- if yes, then the exporting process may need to be done separately for each travel app
- are received notifications by email, through the app, or both? (or it depends on the notification)
- photos taken as evidence are taken as is - should the app also suggest some fields to be filled out for each photo?
    	- such as cost, location, item(s) expensed...
	
- the maybe dumb question: is the 2 week expense process just you have 2 weeks to expense your claims? ))
