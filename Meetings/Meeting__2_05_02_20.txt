Questions and answers:

Questions:

        1. Having to either have an admin sign in or have the admin access the app from the back end to add 		
		2. If we enter the wrong email or pass itll give us an error (client to us)
		3. Can we implement a reset password feature for the app
        4. How many times will the user get their password or email wrong before the user gets their account locked


Answer:

        1. So either the we could add an admin login method to the app, or just have the admin do it from the backend of the app
		2. Yes, this will not allow you to log into the app
		3. Yes, this is another story feature so we will push this story next
        4. Use the industry standard feature, so probably 3 attempts
