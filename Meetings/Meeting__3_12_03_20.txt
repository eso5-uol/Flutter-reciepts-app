Meeting with Michaela on wednesday morning. 
 
 Discovered usability ussues when demoing the progress of the log-in feature.
    Review updating password for the characters available and accidentally clic
        off the screen. 
    Shouldn't be able to block a user account that doesn't exist.
    Add confirmation of user actions eg: "password has been changed successfully"
    

A submitted  form should be shown to employee's manager who approves it before
    being shown to the finance team - they will store the payment informaion.

Make sure to allow for multi-currency claims. 

User story priority:
1. Finish current stories - expence form and login process
2. Admins can create a accounts
3. Perhaps split expence form into separate stories
